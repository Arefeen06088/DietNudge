We are proposing a decision tree based postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) detection method which produces linear and interpretable decision boundaries for producing guidelines to follow. The inputs to the model are carb composition, carb and fat amount, insulin amount, time elapsed since last insulin dose, starting blood glucose concentration. Although we are proposing personalized models as they produce better results, we have results for generalized models as well. We also employed recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify the most significant factors leading to PPHG events.
